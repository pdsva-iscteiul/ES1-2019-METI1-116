          There were problems related with Software Process Mining tool in Pedro's computer. The credentials were not valid for unknown reasons. But the team considers that was not important, because Pedro was the scrum master and focused more in Trello platform, therefore he was the one who implemented less code, making the process mining tool less relevant for his case in specific.
